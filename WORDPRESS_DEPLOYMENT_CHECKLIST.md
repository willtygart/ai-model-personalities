# WordPress Deployment Checklist - Required Before GitHub Can Deploy

This document outlines all items that must be completed before GitHub Actions can successfully deploy to the WordPress site at wordpress.tygartmedia.com.

## 🔧 Current Status
- ✅ WordPress site is live at https://wordpress.tygartmedia.com
- ✅ GitHub repository structure exists
- ✅ Basic GitHub Actions workflow file exists
- ❌ **Deployment pipeline is NOT functional** - only creates notification posts

---

## 🎯 Critical Items (Deployment Blockers)

### 1. GitHub Repository Secrets Configuration
**Status: REQUIRED** ❌
```
Required secrets to add in GitHub repository settings:
- WP_USERNAME: WordPress admin username
- WP_PASSWORD: WordPress application password (NOT regular password)  
- GCP_SA_KEY: Google Cloud service account JSON key
```

**How to configure:**
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add each secret with the exact names above
3. Get WordPress application password from WP admin → Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords

### 2. WordPress Application Passwords Setup
**Status: REQUIRED** ❌
- WordPress must have application passwords enabled
- Need to generate application password specifically for GitHub Actions
- Regular WordPress login password will NOT work for API authentication

**Steps:**
1. Login to WordPress admin at wordpress.tygartmedia.com/wp-admin
2. Go to Users → Your Profile
3. Scroll to "Application Passwords" section
4. Create new application password named "GitHub Deployment"
5. Copy the generated password (you can't see it again)
6. Use this as the `WP_PASSWORD` secret in GitHub

### 3. File Deployment Implementation
**Status: CRITICAL** ❌
- Current workflow only creates WordPress posts
- **No actual file transfer happens**
- Theme files are not synced to WordPress server

**Required implementation:**
- Add SFTP/SSH/FTP deployment step to workflow
- Sync `wordpress/themes/tygartmedia-theme/` to WordPress server
- Configure server connection details
- Add file permission handling

### 4. WordPress Server Access
**Status: REQUIRED** ❌
- Need server credentials for file deployment
- SSH/SFTP/FTP access to WordPress hosting server
- Write permissions to WordPress themes directory

**Required information:**
- Server hostname/IP
- SSH/FTP credentials  
- WordPress installation path on server
- File permission requirements

## 🔄 Enhanced Deployment Features

### 5. Google Cloud Platform Integration
**Status: PLANNED** ⏳
- GCP service account configuration
- Cloud deployment automation
- Secrets management via GCP

### 6. Staging Environment
**Status: MISSING** ❌
- No staging/preview deployment
- All changes go directly to production
- Need separate staging WordPress instance

### 7. Missing Directory Structure
**Status: INCOMPLETE** ❌
```
Expected structure:
wordpress/
├── themes/tygartmedia-theme/ ✅ (exists)
├── plugins/ ❌ (missing)
└── content/ ❌ (missing structured content)
```

### 8. Deployment Testing & Validation
**Status: MISSING** ❌
- No automated testing of deployed changes
- No rollback mechanism
- No deployment verification

3. **Implement file deployment mechanism** in GitHub Actions
4. **Test basic theme deployment**

### Phase 2: Add Google Cloud Integration  
5. Configure GCP service account
6. Add GCP deployment steps
7. Configure GCP secrets management

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
8. Create staging environment
9. Add automated testing
10. Implement rollback procedures
11. Add deployment notifications

## 🚨 Immediate Action Items

**Before any deployment can work:**

1. **WordPress Admin Access** 
   - Verify admin access to wordpress.tygartmedia.com/wp-admin
   - Generate application password for GitHub

2. **Server Access**
   - Obtain server/hosting credentials for file deployment
   - Verify write permissions to WordPress directory

3. **GitHub Configuration**
   - Add required secrets to repository
   - Test secret access in GitHub Actions

4. **Workflow Implementation**
   - Add actual file deployment code to `.github/workflows/deploy-wordpress.yml`
   - Replace placeholder deployment with real file sync

## 🔍 How to Test Deployment

Once configured, test by:
1. Making a small change to WordPress theme file
2. Committing to `main` branch  
3. Checking GitHub Actions logs
4. Verifying files are updated on WordPress site
5. Confirming site still works after deployment
