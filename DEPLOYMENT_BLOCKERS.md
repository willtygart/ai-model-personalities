# WordPress Deployment Blockers - Action Required

## 🚨 Critical Issue: No File Deployment Happens

**Current Problem:** The GitHub Actions workflow only creates WordPress blog posts to announce "deployment" but **does not actually deploy any files**.

## 📋 Immediate Action Items (Required for Any Deployment)

### 1. WordPress Authentication Setup ❌
**What's needed:**
- Generate WordPress Application Password (not regular password)
- Add `WP_USERNAME` and `WP_PASSWORD` to GitHub repository secrets

**Steps:**
1. Login to wordpress.tygartmedia.com/wp-admin
2. Go to Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords
3. Create password named "GitHub Actions"
4. Add to GitHub repo secrets

### 2. Add File Deployment to Workflow ❌
**Current workflow flaw:**
- Line 73-81: Only creates a WordPress post
- **Missing:** Actual file transfer mechanism

**Required additions to `.github/workflows/deploy-wordpress.yml`:**
- SFTP/SSH deployment step
- File sync from `wordpress/themes/` to server
- Server connection configuration

### 3. Server Access Credentials ❌
**Missing information:**
- WordPress hosting server details (SSH/SFTP)
- Server path to WordPress installation
- File permissions configuration

### 4. Google Cloud Integration ❌
**Referenced but not implemented:**
- `GCP_SA_KEY` secret mentioned but unused in workflow
- No GCP deployment steps exist

## 🔧 Technical Gaps in Current Workflow

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PHP Syntax Check | ✅ Working | Tests pass |
| Security Validation | ✅ Working | Tests pass |
| WordPress API Test | ❌ Broken | No credentials configured |
| File Deployment | ❌ Missing | Only creates blog posts |
| Server Connection | ❌ Missing | No server access configured |
| Rollback Mechanism | ❌ Missing | No failure recovery |

## 🎯 Minimum Viable Deployment

**To make basic deployment work:**

1. **Configure secrets** in GitHub repository
2. **Add file deployment step** to workflow (example):
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy Files via SFTP
     uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.3
     with:
       server: ${{ secrets.FTP_SERVER }}
       username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
       password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
       local-dir: wordpress/themes/tygartmedia-theme/
       server-dir: /wp-content/themes/tygartmedia-theme/
   ```
3. **Test deployment** with small change

## 📞 Next Steps

**The repository has the structure but lacks the deployment mechanism.**

To complete setup, need:
- WordPress hosting provider access details
- Application password generation
- Workflow enhancement with actual file deployment

**Current status: 30% complete - infrastructure exists but deployment doesn't work**
