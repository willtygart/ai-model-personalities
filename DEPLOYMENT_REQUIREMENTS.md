## ‚úÖ What's Already Done
- GitHub repository structure exists
- WordPress theme files are ready
- GitHub Actions workflow file exists
- PHP syntax validation works
- WordPress site is live at wordpress.tygartmedia.com

### 2. WordPress Site Setup  
- [ ] Generate WordPress application password for GitHub Actions
- [ ] Enable WordPress REST API access
- [ ] Verify WordPress admin access permissions
- [ ] Test WordPress API endpoint connectivity

### 3. File Deployment Implementation

- [ ] Determine WordPress installation path on server

### 5. Google Cloud Platform Integration
- [ ] Create Google Cloud service account

- [ ] Implement GCP deployment pipeline

### 6. Workflow Enhancements
- [ ] Add staging environment deployment

## üö® Current Blocker

**The workflow currently only creates WordPress blog posts announcing "deployment" but does not actually deploy any files to the WordPress server.**

## Priority Order

**Phase 1 (Critical):**
1. WordPress application password setup
2. GitHub secrets configuration
3. Add file deployment mechanism to workflow

**Phase 2 (Enhancement):**
4. Google Cloud integration
5. Staging environment
6. Advanced monitoring and rollback

## Status: 30% Complete
Infrastructure exists but core deployment functionality is missing.
